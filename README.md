# BracuNetwork

### BracuNetwork is a database website which I made using SQL,PHP,HTML,CSS & Bootstrap.
<br>
The Software/Server which I used is the XAMPP Control Panel, PHPMyAdmin & Visual Studio Code.
<br>
A picture of the table structure named "TableStructure&Connection.png" has been uploaded which I also attached below. So you can easily make it in PHPMyAdmin or you can import the SQL file.

<br>
<br>
You have to just copy and paste the "bracunetwork" folder in your "\xampp\htdocs" and after that, you can connect these PHP files with XAMPP and also access them using Visual Studio Code or your prefered editor.
